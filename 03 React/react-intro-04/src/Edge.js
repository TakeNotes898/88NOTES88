        <p>Edge of Tomorrow (marketed as Live Die Repeat: Edge of Tomorrow on home media, or simply Live Die Repeat)[4][nb 1] is a 2014 American science fiction action film starring Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt. Doug Liman directed the film based on a screenplay adapted from the 2004 Japanese light novel All You Need Is Kill by Hiroshi Sakurazaka. The film takes place in a future where most of Europe is invaded by an alien race. Major William Cage (Cruise), a public relations officer with no combat experience, is forced by his superiors to join a landing operation against the aliens. Though Cage is killed in combat, he finds himself in a time loop that sends him back to the day preceding the battle every time he dies, with some memory of events. Cage teams up with Special Forces warrior Rita Vrataski (Blunt) to improve his fighting skills through the repeated days, while looking for a way to defeat the extraterrestrial invaders.</p>

        <p>In late 2009, 3 Arts Entertainment purchased the rights to the Japanese novel and sold a spec script to the American studio Warner Bros. The studio produced the film with the involvement of 3 Arts, the novel's publisher Viz Media, and Australian production company Village Roadshow. Filming began in late 2012, taking place in England: at WB Studios in Leavesden, outside London, and other locations, such as London's Trafalgar Square and the coastal Saunton Sands. A total of nine companies handled the visual effects.</p>

        <p>Warner Bros. spent over $100 million advertising the film. It was released in cinemas on the weekend of May 30, 2014, in 28 territories, including the United Kingdom, Brazil, Germany, Spain, and Indonesia. On the weekend of June 6, it was released in 36 additional territories, including North America (United States and Canada), Australia, China, and Russia. The film received positive reviews from critics, with many praising the plot, action sequences and performances of Cruise and Blunt.[6] It grossed over $370.5 million worldwide in its theatrical run.[3] A sequel, titled Live Die Repeat and Repeat, is in development.</p>
