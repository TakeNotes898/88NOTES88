        <p>Legally Blonde is a 2001 American comedy film based on Amanda Brown's novel of the same name, scripted by Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith, and directed by Robert Luketic, in his feature-length directorial debut. Reese Witherspoon stars as Elle Woods, a sorority girl who attempts to win back her ex-boyfriend, played by Matthew Davis, by getting a Juris Doctor degree at Harvard Law School, and in the process, overcomes stereotypes against blondes and triumphs as a successful lawyer through unflappable self-confidence and fashion/beauty knowhow. Alanna Ubach, Jessica Cauffiel, Luke Wilson, Selma Blair, Victor Garber, and Jennifer Coolidge appear in supporting roles.</p>

        <p>The film was based on Brown's experiences as a blonde going to Stanford Law School while being obsessed with fashion and beauty, reading Elle magazine, and frequently clashing with the personalities of her peers.[3] In 2000, Brown met producer Marc Platt, who helped her develop her manuscript into a novel. Platt brought in screenwriters McCullah Lutz and Smith to adapt the book into a motion picture.[4] The project caught the attention of director Luketic, an Australian newcomer who came to Hollywood on the success of his quirky debut short film Titsiana Booberini. "I had been reading scripts for two years, not finding anything I could put my own personal mark on, until Legally Blonde came around," Luketic said.[5][6]</p>

        <p>The film was released on July 13, 2001, and was a hit with audiences, grossing $141 million worldwide on an $18 million budget, as well as receiving positive reviews from critics, with particular praise going to Witherspoon's performance. It was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture: Musical or Comedy[7] and ranked 29th on Bravo's 2007 list of "100 Funniest Movies".[8] Witherspoon received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress â€“ Motion Picture Musical or Comedy, and the 2002 MTV Movie Award for Best Female Performance.</p>

        <p>The box office success led to a series of films: a 2003 sequel, Legally Blonde 2: Red, White & Blonde, and a 2009 direct-to-DVD spin-off, Legally Blondes. Additionally, Legally Blonde: The Musical premiered on January 23, 2007, in San Francisco and opened in New York City at the Palace Theatre on Broadway on April 29, 2007, starring Laura Bell Bundy.</p>

        <p>As of June 2018, Witherspoon has been in discussions with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer to produce a third installment in the Legally Blonde film series. In addition to reprising her role as Elle Woods, Witherspoon is in talks to bring back McCullah Lutz and Smith to pen the film's script.[9]</p>
